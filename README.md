# DataPipeline

We leveraged the powerful Apache Spark and Python Libraries to oversee the ETL process of extracting raw Weather Station data, converting and pre-processing it in order to derive meaningful insights as well as future trends in weather patterns in the Shannon region of Ireland. The data is collected from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), which is an organisation that provides real-time and accurate weather data from across the globe.
